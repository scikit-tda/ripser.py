# Ripser.py

Ripser.py is a lean persistent homology package for Python. Building on the blazing fast C++ Ripser package as the core computational engine, Ripser.py provides an intuitive interface for

- computing persistence cohomology of sparse and dense data sets,
- visualizing persistence diagrams,
- computing lowerstar filtrations on images, and
- computing representative cochains.

Additionally, through extensive testing and continuous integration, Ripser.py is easy to install on Mac, Linux, and Windows platforms.

To aid your use of the package, we've put together a large set of notebooks that demonstrate many of the features available. Complete documentation about the package can be found at [ripser.scikit-tda.org](https://ripser.scikit-tda.org).

## Related Projects

If you're looking for the original C++ library, you can find it at [Ripser/ripser](https://github.com/ripser/ripser).

If you're looking for a GPU-accelerated version of Ripser, you can find it at [Ripser++](https://github.com/simonzhang00/ripser-plusplus)

## Setup

Ripser.py is available on `pypi` with wheels for all major platforms. To install, type the following command into your environment:

```bash
pip install ripser
```

### Local build

If the above command fails or if you want to develop and contribute to
`ripser.py`, you can build `ripser.py` locally. To do so, clone this
repository. From within the cloned repository, execute `pip install .` to build
locally, or `pip install -e .` for a local,
[editable](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html)
build. Either of the above two commands will install all required dependencies.
Explicitly, the dependencies of `ripser.py` are

- Cython,
- numpy,
- scipy,
- scikit-learn,
- persim,

and their required dependencies.

**Windows users:** If you are using a Windows machine, you _may_ also need to install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org) on your system.

**Mac users:** Updating your Xcode and Xcode command line tools will probably fix any issues you have with installation.

#### Optional dependency

Ripser.py when compiled from source can have a _steroid_<sup>1</sup> shot by replacing the standard `unordered_map` from the STL by one of the fastest implementation available: [robin_hood](https://github.com/martinus/robin-hood-hashing). Benchmarking of Ripser.py using the `robin_hood` implementation showed speed-ups up to **30%**.

To be able to use `robin_hood` instead of STL, you only need to clone the repository containing the implementation:

```
# Run this command at the root of the project
git clone https://github.com/martinus/robin-hood-hashing robinhood
```

After cloning robinhood with the above command, install `ripser.py` with

```
pip install -v .
```

This will install a local version of `ripser.py` with verbose output. In the verbose output,
you will see confirmation that robinhood was found or not.

<sup>1</sup> The Python package is already compiled with `robin_hood` by default.

If you are having trouble installing, please let us know!

## Usage

The interface is as simple as can be:

```
import numpy as np
from ripser import ripser
from persim import plot_diagrams

data = np.random.random((100,2))
diagrams = ripser(data)['dgms']
plot_diagrams(diagrams, show=True)
```

You can also estimate the RAM requirements before running Ripser:

```python
import numpy as np
from ripser import estimate_ripser_memory

data = np.random.random((1000, 2))
estimated_gb = estimate_ripser_memory(data, maxdim=2)
print(f"Estimated RAM required: {estimated_gb:.2f} GB")
```

We also supply a Scikit-learn transformer style object if you would prefer to use that:

```
import numpy as np
from ripser import Rips

rips = Rips()
data = np.random.random((100,2))
diagrams = rips.fit_transform(data)
rips.plot(diagrams)
```
