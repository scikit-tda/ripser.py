# Ripser.py

Ripser.py is a lean persistent homology package for Python. Building on the blazing fast C++ Ripser package as the core computational engine, Ripser.py provides an intuitive interface for

- computing persistence cohomology of sparse and dense data sets,
- visualizing persistence diagrams,
- computing lowerstar filtrations on images, and
- computing representative cochains.

Additionally, through extensive testing and continuous integration, Ripser.py is easy to install on Mac, Linux, and Windows platforms.

To aid your use of the package, we've put together a large set of notebooks that demonstrate many of the features available. Complete documentation about the package can be found at [ripser.scikit-tda.org](https://ripser.scikit-tda.org).

## Related Projects

If you're looking for the original C++ library, you can find it at [Ripser/ripser](https://github.com/ripser/ripser).

If you're looking for a GPU-accelerated version of Ripser, you can find it at [Ripser++](https://github.com/simonzhang00/ripser-plusplus)

## Setup

Ripser.py is available on all major platforms. All that is required is that you install the standard Python numerical computing libraries and Cython.

Dependencies:

- Cython
- numpy
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- persim

**Windows users:** If you are using a Windows machine, you will also need to install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org) on your system.

**Mac users:** Updating your Xcode and Xcode command line tools will probably fix any issues you have with installation.

Cython should be the only library required before installation. To install, type the following commands into your environment:

```
pip install cython
pip install ripser
```

If you are having trouble installing, please let us know!

## Optional dependency

Ripser.py when compiled from source can have a _steroid_<sup>1</sup> shot by replacing the standard `unordered_map` from the STL by one of the fastest implementation available: [robin_hood](https://github.com/martinus/robin-hood-hashing). Benchmarking of Ripser.py using the `robin_hood` implementation showed speed-ups up to **30%**.

To be able to use `robin_hood` instead of STL, you only need to clone the repository containing the implementation:

```
# Run this command at the root of the project
git clone https://github.com/martinus/robin-hood-hashing ripser/robinhood
```

<sup>1</sup> The Python package is already compiled with `robin_hood` by default.

## Usage

The interface is as simple as can be:

```
import numpy as np
from ripser import ripser
from persim import plot_diagrams

data = np.random.random((100,2))
diagrams = ripser(data)['dgms']
plot_diagrams(diagrams, show=True)
```

We also supply a Scikit-learn transformer style object if you would prefer to use that:

```
import numpy as np
from ripser import Rips

rips = Rips()
data = np.random.random((100,2))
diagrams = rips.fit_transform(data)
rips.plot(diagrams)
```
