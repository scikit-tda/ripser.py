Ripser.py is a lean persistent homology package for Python. Building on the blazing fast C++ Ripser package as the core computational engine, Ripser.py provides an intuitive interface for 

- computing persistence cohomology of sparse and dense data sets, 
- visualizing persistence diagrams, 
- computing lowerstar filtrations on images, and 
- computing representative cochains. 

We supply a large set of interactive notebooks that demonstrate how to take advantage of all the features available.

Ripser.py is an evolution of the original C++ Ripser project. We have put extensive work into making the package available to Python developers across all major platforms. If you are having trouble installing, please let us know by opening a github issue.


You can find the source code on github at `Scikit-TDA/Ripser.py <https://github.com/scikit-tda/ripser.py>`_. For the original C++ library, see `Ripser/ripser <https://github.com/Ripser/ripser>`_.



Setup
------

Ripser.py is available on Pypi. To install, you'll first need Cython. 

.. code:: python

    pip install Cython
    pip install Ripser

Example Usage
--------------

The interface is as simple as can be:


.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from ripser import ripser
    from persim import plot_diagrams

    data = np.random.random((100,2))
    diagrams = ripser(data)['dgms']
    plot_diagrams(diagrams, show=True)


We also supply a Scikit-learn transformer style object if you would prefer to use that:

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from ripser import Rips

    rips = Rips()
    data = np.random.random((100,2))
    diagrams = rips.fit_transform(data)
    rips.plot(diagrams)

Source Compilation
---------------------

In order to compile, you'll first need to do:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/scikit-tda/ripser.py
    cd ripser.py
    pip install -e .

You'll then be able to use Ripser.py as in the previous examples but compiled directly from sources.
In order to obtain the best experience in performances when compiling from sources, you'll need an additional library, robin_hood_hashmap. To be able to use compile with this library enable, do:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/martinus/robin-hood-hashing ripser/robinhood

The following table shows a comparison of performances with and without robin_hood_hashmap:
